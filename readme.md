## TODO
* Artist bios don't scroll
* Drag a song on to the chooser to add it to a playlist
* Drag the album art on to the chooser to add it to a playlist
* Play plays the track but lists the album as the playing source (so the next song is the next track on the album)
* History/Url handling
* Wire up the player buttons
* Style user options
* Handle changing the chooser when you change the user
* Improve help to know what you've already done and what your next step should be (reduce text)
* Reset properly
* Use the total number of albums in a playlist to determine what the ideal thumb size is
* Player should shake when the song changes
* Look into using playing source to only bump currently playing song to the queue if that's where it came from
